Drug Outcome Prediction Using Bayesian Optimization

 Overview
This project explores techniques to predict the outcome of drug administration based on various patient features using machine learning algorithms. By implementing Bayesian Optimization, we aim to optimize hyperparameters to enhance the accuracy of our predictive model.

 Context
As a beginner in machine learning, this project serves as a valuable opportunity to apply various techniques and understand their effectiveness in predicting patient-specific drug outcomes.

 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains patient information, including:

- Target Feature: 
  - Drug Type: The type of drug administered to the patient.

- Feature Set:
  - Age: Age of the patient.
  - Sex: Gender of the patient (binary: Male/Female).
  - Blood Pressure Levels (BP): Recorded blood pressure levels.
  - Cholesterol Levels: Recorded cholesterol levels.
  - Na to Potassium Ratio: Ratio of sodium to potassium in the patient's body.

 Implementation Steps

1. Dataset Acquisition:
   - Obtain a dataset from sources like Kaggle that includes the specified features and target drug type.

2. Data Preparation:
   - Load the dataset using pandas.
   - Handle missing values appropriately.
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., converting `Sex` to numerical format).
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Analyze the distribution of features and check for correlations.

4. Model Selection:
   - Choose a machine learning model suitable for classification tasks (e.g., Random Forest).

5. Hyperparameter Tuning with Bayesian Optimization:
   - Use the skopt library to optimize hyperparameters of the selected model.

 Results
The implementation evaluates the model's accuracy based on the optimized hyperparameters and provides a classification report detailing performance metrics.

 Adaptation to Other Machine Learning Models
This Bayesian Optimization approach can be adapted to various machine learning models, such as:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- Neural Networks
- Logistic Regression

Simply modify the model initialization in the objective function and adjust the search space according to the hyperparameters relevant to the chosen model.
